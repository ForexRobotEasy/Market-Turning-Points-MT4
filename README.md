# Market Turning Points MT4 ReadMe

This code is a custom indicator for MetaTrader 4 (MT4) called Market Turning Points. It is developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team and is designed to identify and plot market turning points, analyze market structure, calculate support and resistance zones, and detect breakouts.

## Global Variables
- `MarketTurningPointsBuffer`: Holds the values of the market turning points.
- `SupportLevelsBuffer`: Stores the values of support levels.
- `ResistanceLevelsBuffer`: Stores the values of resistance levels.
- `EntryPointsBuffer`: Stores the values of entry points.
- `ProfitTargetsBuffer`: Stores the values of profit targets.
- `BreakoutZonesBuffer`: Stores the values of breakout zones.
- `BreakoutAlert`: A boolean flag to indicate if a breakout alert is triggered.

## Initialization Function
The `OnInit` function is called during the expert initialization. It maps the indicator buffers to the corresponding index and sets the index labels for each buffer.

## Deinitialization Function
The `OnDeinit` function is called during the expert deinitialization. It cleans up the indicator buffers by initializing them with the `EMPTY_VALUE`.

## Tick Function
The `OnTick` function is called on each tick of the market. It is where the main logic of the indicator is implemented. The code is currently incomplete and requires further implementation in the following areas:
1. Identifying and plotting market turning points.
2. Analyzing market structure and identifying trading ranges.
3. Calculating and displaying support and resistance zones.
4. Detecting breakouts and sending alerts.

## Custom Functions
The `DetectBreakout` function is a custom function that should be implemented to detect breakouts. It is currently empty and needs to be filled with the appropriate code.
